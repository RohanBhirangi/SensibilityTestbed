**Gravity**

1. Keep the device flat on the table<br>
Expected Outcome: output of gravity sensor identical to accelerometer value<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Flat table<br>

2. Drop the device on an inclined table (table is inclined at an angle (θ) to the gravity vector)<br>
Expected Outcome: force of gravity along x-axis = 9.81 x cos(θ); force of gravity along z-axis = 9.81 x sin(θ)<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Flat table<br>
