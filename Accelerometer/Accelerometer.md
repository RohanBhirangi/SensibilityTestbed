**Accelerometer**

1. Push the device on its horizontal axis (against a rigid surface like a wall) in a to and fro motion (towards the right and then towards the left)<br>
Expected Outcome: x acceleration value positive<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Flat table<br>

2. Push the device on its vertical axis (against a rigid surface like a wall) in a to and fro motion (towards the head and then towards the bottom)<br>
Expected Outcome: y acceleration value positive<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Flat table<br>

3. Keep the device flat on the table<br>
Expected Outcome: acceleration value +9.81<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Flat table<br>

4. Drop the device onto a pillow (from 1-2 meters)<br>
Expected Outcome: absolute acceleration value zero<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Pillow<br>

5. Move the device in a clockwise (or anti-clockwise) direction along the surfaces of a rectangular shoe box (or some other rigid surface)<br>
Expected Outcome: the x-accelertation and y-acceleration values cancel each other out and become zero<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Flat table, Shoe box<br>

6. Device free fall on an inclined table (table is inclined at an angle (θ) to the gravity vector)<br>
Expected Outcome: force of gravity along x-axis = 9.81 x cos(θ); force of gravity along z-axis = 9.81 x sin(θ)<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Flat table<br>
