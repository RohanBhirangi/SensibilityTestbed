**Accelerometer**

1. Push the device on its left side towards the right<br>
Expected Outcome: x acceleration value positive<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Flat table<br>

2. Push the device on its right side towards the left<br>
Expected Outcome: x acceleration value negative<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Flat table<br>

3. Push the device towards its head<br>
Expected Outcome: y acceleration value positive<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Flat table<br>

4. Push the device towards its bottom<br>
Expected Outcome: y acceleration value negative<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Flat table<br>

5. Keep the device flat on the table<br>
Expected Outcome: acceleration value +9.81<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Flat table<br>

6. Drop the device onto a pillow (from 1-2 meters)<br>
Expected Outcome: absolute acceleration value zero<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Pillow<br>

7. Device free fall on an inclined table (table is inclined at an angle (Î¸) to the gravity vector)<br>
Expected Outcome: acceleration along x-axis = acceleration along y-axis = acceleration along z-axis = 0<br>
Required Material: Smartphone, Flat table<br>
